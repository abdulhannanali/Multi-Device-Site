# Multiple Device Site

Multiple Device Site guide will make me familiar with developing for Multiple devices with 
responsive screen sizes. This is a world of dynamic web applications and in this world, there's 
never one solution of how we should design our application. Multi Device Site guide will help in improving this.

### Questions for the site I am building?

Some questions that will help me brainstorming about the website I am building.
This is going to be a sample landing page.

- What is the content I am building for?

  Landing page for **FreshAppleFarm**. This landing page will describe the unique qualities 
  of the apples and how they are grown in the fresh environment and are hand picked.
  Will list the key people at farm, and there can also be an initial
  preordering form to order apples. The landing page will also have a form 
  to get promotional offers from freshappleFarms.

  The tabular data will contain the nutritional facts of Apple for 
  getting this data quickly I will copy this from Google.

  So the information by priority

  - Basic Information and top points about FreshAppleFarms
  - Form to collect email to send different promotions for apples
  - Indepth description and video of apple growing process
  - Images of People who make this possible
  - Nutritional Facts of the Apple
  - Disclaimers

Now we can design for the content. 

What is important first?

We want people to get familiar with the brand of FreshAppleFarms and our unique qualities
along with our  offering. Since we are offering for mobile, it's important we first serve 
the content we thing is important. Also, the site should be usable even without loading
background image of Apples.

### Style guide contains the colors we are going to use for our website

The colors of the style guide are available in [styleguide.css](styleguide.css).
The text of our site should be consistent in the font and color, to make the
experience well designed. I can use color styles for different other things
